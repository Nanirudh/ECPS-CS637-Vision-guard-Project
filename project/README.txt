1. visionguard_gtsrb.ipyb is the implemention of vision guard algorithm on gtsrb (german traffic sign dataset)
2. Digital attacks fgsm,pjd, cw have been implemeted.
3. Simulink stateflow model is vg_proj.slx 
4. input.txt, isAdv.txt and get_input.txt is used by  visionguard_gtsrb.ipyb and stateflow model for 
   communication.
5. matlab functions "get_input.m" is used to check if input is present and "check_adv.m" is used if the input 
   image is adversarial

6. visionguard_mnist.ipyb is the implementation of vision guard algorithm on mnist(hand written digits) dataset
